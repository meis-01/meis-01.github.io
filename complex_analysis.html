            <h2>1. Complex Numbers and Their Properties</h2>
            <p>Complex numbers are numbers that have both a real part and an imaginary part. They are usually written in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit with the property i² = -1.</p>
            <p>Complex numbers can be represented geometrically in the complex plane, where the x-axis represents the real part and the y-axis represents the imaginary part. This representation is useful for visualizing operations on complex numbers.</p>
            <p>Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form, which consists of a magnitude and an angle. This form is particularly useful for multiplication and division of complex numbers.</p>

            <h2>2. Analytic Functions</h2>
            <p>An analytic function is a function that is locally given by a convergent power series. These functions are also known as holomorphic functions.</p>
            <p>Analytic functions have many important properties, including the fact that they are infinitely differentiable and that their Taylor series converges to the function in a neighborhood of any point where the function is analytic.</p>
            <p>Examples of analytic functions include polynomials, exponential functions, and trigonometric functions.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>3. Cauchy-Riemann Equations</h2>
            <p>The Cauchy-Riemann equations are a set of two partial differential equations that provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a function to be analytic.</p>
            <p>If a function f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is analytic, then the partial derivatives of u and v must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations: ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x.</p>
            <p>These equations are fundamental in complex analysis and are used to determine whether a given function is analytic.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>4. Contour Integration</h2>
            <p>Contour integration is a method of evaluating integrals of complex functions along a path, or contour, in the complex plane.</p>
            <p>This technique is particularly useful for evaluating integrals that are difficult or impossible to compute using standard real-variable methods.</p>
            <p>One of the key results in contour integration is Cauchy's integral theorem, which states that the integral of an analytic function around a closed contour is zero.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>5. Cauchy's Integral Formula</h2>
            <p>Cauchy's integral formula is a fundamental result in complex analysis that expresses the value of an analytic function inside a contour in terms of an integral over the contour.</p>
            <p>If f(z) is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, and a is a point inside C, then f(a) = (1/2πi) ∫(f(z)/(z-a)) dz, where the integral is taken over C.</p>
            <p>This formula has many important consequences, including the fact that analytic functions are infinitely differentiable and that their derivatives can be computed using contour integrals.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>6. Laurent Series</h2>
            <p>The Laurent series is a representation of a complex function as a series that includes both positive and negative powers of the variable.</p>
            <p>This series is particularly useful for representing functions that have singularities, or points where the function is not analytic.</p>
            <p>The Laurent series can be used to classify singularities and to compute residues, which are important in the evaluation of contour integrals.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>7. Residue Theorem</h2>
            <p>The residue theorem is a powerful tool in complex analysis that allows the evaluation of contour integrals by relating them to the residues of the integrand at its singularities.</p>
            <p>If f(z) is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, except for a finite number of singularities, then the integral of f(z) around C is 2πi times the sum of the residues of f(z) at its singularities inside C.</p>
            <p>This theorem is widely used in the evaluation of integrals and in the solution of problems in physics and engineering.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>8. Conformal Mapping</h2>
            <p>A conformal mapping is a function that preserves angles and the shapes of infinitesimally small figures.</p>
            <p>Conformal mappings are used to transform complex functions and to solve problems in complex analysis and applied mathematics.</p>
            <p>One of the most important conformal mappings is the Riemann mapping theorem, which states that any simply connected, non-empty open subset of the complex plane can be mapped conformally onto the unit disk.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>9. Riemann Surfaces</h2>
            <p>A Riemann surface is a one-dimensional complex manifold that provides a natural setting for the study of complex functions.</p>
            <p>Riemann surfaces are used to extend the domain of complex functions and to study their properties in a more general context.</p>
            <p>Examples of Riemann surfaces include the complex plane, the Riemann sphere, and the torus.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>10. Analytic Continuation</h2>
            <p>Analytic continuation is a method of extending the domain of an analytic function beyond its original region of definition.</p>
            <p>This technique is used to define functions on larger domains and to study their properties in a more general context.</p>
            <p>Analytic continuation is widely used in complex analysis and in the study of special functions, such as the gamma function and the zeta function.</p>
