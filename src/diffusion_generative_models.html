            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Diffusion generative models are a class of generative models that learn to generate data by reversing a diffusion process. They have shown great promise in generating high-quality images and other types of data.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="background">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The concept of diffusion processes originates from physics and stochastic processes. In the context of generative models, it involves gradually adding noise to data and then learning to reverse this process.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="diffusion-process">
            <h2>Diffusion Process</h2>
            <p>The diffusion process involves adding Gaussian noise to data over several steps, creating a sequence of increasingly noisy data. This process is modeled as a Markov chain.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="reverse-diffusion">
            <h2>Reverse Diffusion</h2>
            <p>Reverse diffusion is the process of denoising the data, step by step, to recover the original data distribution. This is achieved by training a neural network to predict the noise added at each step.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="model-architecture">
            <h2>Model Architecture</h2>
            <p>The architecture of diffusion generative models typically includes a neural network that predicts the noise at each step of the reverse diffusion process. Common architectures include U-Nets and Transformer-based models.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="training-procedure">
            <h2>Training Procedure</h2>
            <p>Training diffusion generative models involves minimizing a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted noise and the actual noise added during the diffusion process. This is often done using stochastic gradient descent.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="applications">
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Diffusion generative models have applications in image generation, audio synthesis, and other areas where high-quality data generation is required. They are particularly known for generating realistic images.</p>

        <section id="advantages">
            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <p>Advantages of diffusion generative models include their ability to generate high-quality data, their robustness to mode collapse, and their theoretical grounding in stochastic processes.</p>

        <section id="challenges">
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Challenges in diffusion generative models include the computational cost of training and sampling, the need for large amounts of data, and the complexity of the reverse diffusion process.</p>
