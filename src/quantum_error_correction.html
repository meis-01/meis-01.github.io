            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Quantum error correction is a method used to protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. It is essential for the development of reliable quantum computers.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="background">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The concept of quantum error correction was introduced in the mid-1990s. It builds on classical error correction techniques but addresses the unique challenges posed by quantum mechanics.</p>

        <section id="quantum-bits">
            <h2>Quantum Bits (Qubits)</h2>
            <p>Qubits are the fundamental units of quantum information. Unlike classical bits, qubits can exist in superpositions of states, making error correction more complex.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="types-of-errors">
            <h2>Types of Errors</h2>
            <p>Quantum errors can be broadly classified into bit-flip errors, phase-flip errors, and more general errors that affect both the amplitude and phase of qubits.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="quantum-error-correcting-codes">
            <h2>Quantum Error-Correcting Codes</h2>
            <p>Quantum error-correcting codes are used to detect and correct errors in quantum information. Examples include the Shor code, the Steane code, and the surface code.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="syndrome-measurement">
            <h2>Syndrome Measurement</h2>
            <p>Syndrome measurement is the process of detecting errors in a quantum system without disturbing the quantum information. It involves measuring ancillary qubits that interact with the data qubits.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="fault-tolerant-quantum-computation">
            <h2>Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation</h2>
            <p>Fault-tolerant quantum computation ensures that quantum operations can be performed reliably even in the presence of errors. It involves designing quantum gates and circuits that can tolerate errors.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="threshold-theorem">
            <h2>Threshold Theorem</h2>
            <p>The threshold theorem states that if the error rate per quantum gate is below a certain threshold, quantum error correction can be used to perform arbitrarily long quantum computations reliably.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="applications">
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Quantum error correction is crucial for the development of large-scale quantum computers. It also has applications in quantum communication and quantum cryptography.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="future-directions">
            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
            <p>Future research in quantum error correction focuses on improving error-correcting codes, developing more efficient fault-tolerant protocols, and integrating quantum error correction with quantum hardware.</p>
