            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Quantum Clifford circuits are a subset of quantum circuits that can be efficiently simulated classically. They play a crucial role in quantum computing and quantum error correction.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="clifford-gates">
            <h2>Clifford Gates</h2>
            <p>Clifford gates are a set of quantum gates that include the Hadamard gate, the Phase gate, and the CNOT gate. These gates form the Clifford group, which is closed under composition and inversion.</p>

        <section id="stabilizer-states">
            <h2>Stabilizer States</h2>
            <p>Stabilizer states are quantum states that can be described using stabilizer formalism. They are the states that can be generated by applying Clifford gates to the computational basis states.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="gottesman-knill-theorem">
            <h2>Gottesman-Knill Theorem</h2>
            <p>The Gottesman-Knill theorem states that any quantum computation that involves only Clifford gates, preparation of stabilizer states, and measurements in the computational basis can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="quantum-error-correction">
            <h2>Quantum Error Correction</h2>
            <p>Clifford circuits are fundamental in the implementation of quantum error correction codes, such as the Shor code and the Steane code, which protect quantum information from errors.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="quantum-teleportation">
            <h2>Quantum Teleportation</h2>
            <p>Quantum teleportation is a protocol that uses Clifford circuits to transmit quantum information from one location to another, using entanglement and classical communication.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="bell-states">
            <h2>Bell States</h2>
            <p>Bell states are specific examples of stabilizer states that are maximally entangled. They are used in various quantum information protocols, including quantum teleportation and superdense coding.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="measurement-based-quantum-computation">
            <h2>Measurement-Based Quantum Computation</h2>
            <p>Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a model of quantum computation that uses Clifford circuits to prepare a highly entangled resource state, followed by adaptive measurements.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="surface-codes">
            <h2>Surface Codes</h2>
            <p>Surface codes are a type of quantum error-correcting code that uses a 2D lattice of qubits. Clifford circuits are used to perform error correction and logical operations on the encoded qubits.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="applications">
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Quantum Clifford circuits have applications in quantum error correction, quantum cryptography, and the efficient simulation of certain quantum systems on classical computers.</p>
