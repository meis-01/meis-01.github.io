            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Lie Algebra is a mathematical structure used to study geometric objects and their symmetries. It is named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Lie Algebra was developed in the late 19th century by Sophus Lie. It has since become a fundamental tool in various areas of mathematics and theoretical physics.</p>

            <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
            <p>Lie Algebras are algebraic structures whose elements can be added together and multiplied by scalars, and they also have a binary operation called the Lie bracket.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="lie-bracket">
            <h2>Lie Bracket</h2>
            <p>The Lie bracket is a binary operation that satisfies bilinearity, alternativity, and the Jacobi identity. It is a key component in the definition of a Lie Algebra.</p>
