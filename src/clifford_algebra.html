            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Clifford Algebra is a type of algebra that generalizes complex numbers, quaternions, and several other algebraic systems. It is named after the mathematician William Kingdon Clifford.</p>

        <section id="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The concept of Clifford Algebra was introduced by William Kingdon Clifford in the 19th century. It has since found applications in various fields such as physics, computer science, and engineering.</p>

        <section id="basic-concepts">
            <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
            <p>Clifford Algebra extends the real numbers by introducing new elements that square to negative one. These elements are used to construct multivectors, which are the fundamental objects in Clifford Algebra.</p>

        <section id="geometric-product">
            <h2>Geometric Product</h2>
            <p>The geometric product is the central operation in Clifford Algebra. It combines the dot product and the wedge product (exterior product) into a single operation.</p>
